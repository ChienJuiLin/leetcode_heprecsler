'''
Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

Example 1:

Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] and k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Example 2:

Input: [-1,-100,3,99] and k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
Note:

Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.
Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?

class Solution:
    def rotate(self, nums, k):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type k: int
        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        n = len(nums)
        k = k % n
        nums[:] = nums[n-k:] + nums[:n-k]

# 以下是在討論區挖到的，可我還是不懂為什麼寫成第二種，nums就會被指向新的nums而第一種不會？
'''
A little important thing to be cautious:

nums[:] = nums[n-k:] + nums[:n-k]
can't be written as:

nums = nums[n-k:] + nums[:n-k]
on the OJ.

The previous one can truly change the value of old nums, but the following one just changes its reference to a new nums not the value of old nums.
